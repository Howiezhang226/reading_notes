### The Output of Batch Workflows

Map reduce scans a large row of data and produce a kind of data structure.

Building search indexes

What is search index? look up a particular keyword and find a list of document IDs containing that keyword.



### Key-value stores as batch process output

Another use case of mapreduce output is building a key-value database for web server.

Build a brand-new DB inside the batch job and write it as files

### Comparing Hadoop to Distributed Databases



Diversity of storage

Database: strctured data acorrding to a particular model

Distributed fielsystem: file byte sequences

Diversity of processing models

database: Monolithic, tightly integrated software that takes care of storage layout, SQL query engine, scheduling and execution

Hadoop: diverse and general purpose model of data processing
